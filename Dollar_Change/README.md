# Dollar Changes
You are given dollar notes of different denominations. Youâ€™ve been asked to pay a specific amount of money.
Write a program that makes up that amount with the fewest number of notes. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the notes, return -1.

Examples:
```
1. Array of dollar notes: [2,5,10]
Expected amount: 16
Output: 4
Explanation: [10, 2, 2, 2]
```
```
2. Array of dollar notes: [3,5,10]
Expected amount: 11
Output: 3
